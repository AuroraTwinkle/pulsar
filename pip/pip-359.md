PROPOSAL HEALTH CHECK
I can read the design document and understand the problem statement and what you plan to change *without* resorting to a couple of hours of code reading just to start having a high level understanding of the change.

# PIP-359: Support custom message listener executor for specific subscription

<!--
# Background knowledge
-->

<!--
Describes all the knowledge you need to know in order to understand all the other sections in this PIP

* Give a high level explanation on all concepts you will be using throughout this document. For example, if you want to talk about Persistent Subscriptions, explain briefly (1 paragraph) what this is. If you're going to talk about Transaction Buffer, explain briefly what this is. 
  If you're going to change something specific, then go into more detail about it and how it works. 
* Provide links where possible if a person wants to dig deeper into the background information. 

DON'T
* Do not include links *instead* explanation. Do provide links for further explanation.

EXAMPLES
* See [PIP-248](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/19601), Background section to get an understanding on how you add the background knowledge needed.
  (They also included the motivation there, but ignore it as we place that in Motivation section explicitly).

# Motivation

<!--
Describe the problem this proposal is trying to solve.

* Explain what is the problem you're trying to solve - current situation.
* This section is the "Why" of your proposal.
-->

In the current Pulsar client versions, all consumer instances created from the same PulsarClient
will share a thread pool(`ExecutorProvider`) to process message listeners, and sometimes there are multiple 
consumer message listeners bound to the same thread. Obviously, when a consumer
processes messages and causes long-term blocking, it will cause the messages of
other consumers bound to the same thread to fail to be processed in time, resulting in
message delays. Therefore, for this scenario, it may be necessary to support specific a message
listener executor of consumer latitudes to avoid mutual influence between different consumers.
# Goals
1. Improve consumer message listener isolation, solve the consumption delay problem caused by 
mutual influence of different consumers from the same PulsarClient instance.

## In Scope
<!--
What this PIP intend to achieve once It's integrated into Pulsar.
Why does it benefit Pulsar.
-->
Nothing.

## Out of Scope

<!--
Describe what you have decided to keep out of scope, perhaps left for a different PIP/s.
-->
Nothing.


# High Level Design
Nothing.

<!--
Describe the design of your solution in *high level*.
Describe the solution end to end, from a birds-eye view.
Don't go into implementation details in this section.

I should be able to finish reading from beginning of the PIP to here (including) and understand the feature and 
how you intend to solve it, end to end.

DON'T
* Avoid code snippets, unless it's essential to explain your intent.

# Detailed Design

## Design & Implementation Details
<!--
This is the section where you dive into the details. It can be:
* Concrete class names and their roles and responsibility, including methods.
* Code snippets of existing code.
* Interface names and its methods.
* ...
-->

Add an interface `MessageListenerExecutor`, responsible for executing message listener callback tasks.
Users can customize the implementation to determine in which thread the message listener task is executed.
For example, in the situation described in [Motivation](#motivation) part, users can implement the 
interface with an independent underlying thread pool to ensure that the message listener task of each 
consumer is executed in a separate thread. The caller would be responsible for the life cycle of the 
Executor, and it would be used only for this specific consumer.
```java
public interface MessageListenerExecutor {

    /**
     * select a thread by message(if necessary, for example, 
     * Key_Shared SubscriptionType, maybe need select thread 
     * by message order key to ensure order) to execute the runnable!
     *
     * @param message  the message
     * @param runnable the runnable to execute
     */
    void execute(Message<?> message, Runnable runnable);
}
```

### Usage Example
```java
   private void startConsumerWithMessageListener(String topic, String subscriptionName) {
        ConsumerBuilder<Long> consumerBuilder =
                pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.INT64)
                        .topic(topic)
                        .subscriptionName(subscriptionName)
                        .messageListener((c1, msg) -> {
                            log.info("Received message [{}] in the listener", msg.getValue());
                            c1.acknowledgeAsync(msg);
                        });

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(
                new ExecutorProvider.ExtendedThreadFactory(subscriptionName + "listener-executor-", true));
        // set and then message lister will be executed in the executor
        consumerBuilder.messageListenerExecutor((message, runnable) -> executor.execute(runnable));

        Consumer<Long> consumer = consumerBuilder.subscribe();
    }
```
## Public-facing Changes

<!--
Describe the additions you plan to make for each public facing component. 
Remove the sections you are not changing.
Clearly mark any changes which are BREAKING backward compatability.
-->

### Public API

<!--
When adding a new endpoint to the REST API, please make sure to document the following:

* path
* query parameters
* HTTP body parameters, usually as JSON.
* Response codes, and for each what they mean.
  For each response code, please include a detailed description of the response body JSON, specifying each field and what it means.
  This is the place to document the errors.
-->

1. Add an optional config `messageListenerExecutor` in `ConsumerBuilder`
```java
ConsumerBuilder<T> messageListenerExecutor(MessageListenerExecutor messageListenerExecutor);
```

### Binary protocol
Nothing.

### Configuration
Nothing.

### CLI
Nothing.

### Metrics

<!--
For each metric provide:
* Full name
* Description
* Attributes (labels)
* Unit
-->
Nothing.

# Monitoring

<!-- 
Describe how the changes you make in this proposal should be monitored. 
Don't describe the detailed metrics - they should be at "Public-facing Changes" / "Metrics" section.
Describe how the user will use the metrics to monitor the feature: Which alerts they should set up, which thresholds, ...
-->
Nothing.

# Security Considerations
<!--
A detailed description of the security details that ought to be considered for the PIP. This is most relevant for any new HTTP endpoints, new Pulsar Protocol Commands, and new security features. The goal is to describe details like which role will have permission to perform an action.

An important aspect to consider is also multi-tenancy: Does the feature I'm adding have the permissions / roles set in such a way that prevent one tenant accessing another tenant's data/configuration? For example, the Admin API to read a specific message for a topic only allows a client to read messages for the target topic. However, that was not always the case. CVE-2021-41571 (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/wiki/CVE-2021-41571) resulted because the API was incorrectly written and did not properly prevent a client from reading another topic's messages even though authorization was in place. The problem was missing input validation that verified the requested message was actually a message for that topic. The fix to CVE-2021-41571 was input validation. 

If there is uncertainty for this section, please submit the PIP and request for feedback on the mailing list.
-->
Nothing.

# Backward & Forward Compatibility
You can do upgrading or reverting normally, no specified steps are needed to do.
# Alternatives

If there are alternatives that were already considered by the authors or, after the discussion, by the community, and were rejected, please list them here along with the reason why they were rejected.
